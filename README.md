# Sabbioneta-sidewalks

This repository contains data relating to the doctoral thesis of Daniele Treccani, PhD candidate in cycle XXXIV at the Politecnico di Milano, Department of Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering. The thesis work was carried out in collaboration with the HESUTECH group of the MantovaLAB laboratory of the Politecnico di Milano, at Mantova Campus.

The data is owned by the HESUTECH Group and licensed under ODbL.

The "data" folder contains the vector file ".shp" containing the sidewalk network of the city of Sabbioneta, obtained through calculations performed during the PhD thesis.

The thesis, entitled "POINT CLOUD PROCESSING FOR PHYSICAL ACCESSIBILITY EVALUATION IN HISTORICAL URBAN ENVIRONMENTS. THE CASE OF THE UNESCO SITE OF SABBIONETA", dealt with the development of a semi-automatic procedure for the analysis of a point cloud of a historical urban environment, in order to generate a shapefile containing the network of sidewalks with the relative spatial and geometric attributes, such as width, elevation with respect to the street, longitudinal and transversal slopes, and pavement material.

The shapefile attributes are described in the following table:
